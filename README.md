This repository contains some lessons how to use [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/about/) as a Document database.

It relies on three sessions:

1. [Session 1](./src/session1.md) How to install opensearch using Docker Compose
1. [Session 2](./src/session2.md) A comparison between some python data manipulation and the same usage using Opensearch
1. [Session 3](./src/session3.md) A use case to execute by yourself
