# Manipulate Open Data : Renewable Power Plant

 [Download](https://data.open-power-system-data.org/renewable_power_plants/2020-08-25) csv data. 

# Data discovery

## in terms of power

Use `pandas`to manipulate data ? Number of plants ? Look at the statistical description of the data ? 
Take a closer look at `electrical_power` and at all the quartile ? 
Draw an histogram to have an idea of the distribution of how the power plants power looks like ? 
In particular for the plants that have an `electrical_power` less than a threshold defined by the 90 decile.  

## in terms of localisation.

Implement a function that compute the [haversine](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formule_de_haversine) distance between to plants.
or use [scikit learn function](https://scikit-learn.org/1.6/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.haversine_distances.html) 

```
def haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    ...
```

Then write a code that search the plant the nearest of one of the row of your dataframe.
At the end, you have something like:

```
Nearest plan to "Saint-Flour" is "Tr√©zioux"
```

## export json

1. <a id='json_one'></a>Export several rows of the dataframe as dict in json format. 

1. Export the $N$ first rows of the dataframe in a file in bulk json format 

# Crud Manipulation

1. Create an index called power_plant

1. Index documents using [file](#json_one) 

1. Read the document to check the content of the document

1. Update a fied in this document

1. Reread the document to ensure that the field has been updated.

1. Delete the document

1. Delete the index

# Mapping definition

1. Create an index called power_plant

1. look at the current mapping of your index

1. index document

1. look at the mapping.

1. delete the index

1. Create the right mapping for coordinates
